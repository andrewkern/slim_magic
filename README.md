# slim_magic
This package provides a few ipython magic functions
for (population genetic) simulation using SLiM 
([Haller and Messer, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msy228)). 
These magic functions are not 
meant for heavy, computation.
Instead they are aimed at 
teaching, or gaining a quick
intuition for what a simulation
might produce, without
using the excellent SLiM GUI. 

## usage
Currently there are three separate magic functions implemented, please
see `example_magic.ipynb` for a jupyter notebook example.

The three functions are `%%slim_stats`, `%%slim_stats_reps_cstack`, and
`%%slim_stats_reps_rstack`
